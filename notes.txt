Controller is a class which is associated to one or more routes and is responsible for handling requests of the routes. "Grouping of similar routes together". 

Controllers are in app/Http/Controllers

Can be done with artisan commands. When naming, it is best practice to end the names with Controller

In terminal:  php artisan make:controller CarController 
After it says the controller was successfully made and we can see the new file. 

------ Group Routes by Controller -----

web.php line 131

------ Single Action Controllers ----- 1:19
Single Action Controllers are controllers, that are associated to a single route only. --invokable keyword used to make the controller be a single action controller.

In terminal: php artisan make:controller ShowCarController --invokable

------ Resource Controllers ----- 1:22

In Laravel 'Resource Controller' is a special type of controller that provides a convenient way to handle typical CRUD operations for a resource such as a database table.

In terminal: php artisan make:controller ProductController --resource

This will create a controller like usual but it has several more placeholder functions. 7 default methods

// Route::resource(name:'/products', controller:ProductController::class);

//Route::ApiResource(name:'/products', controller:ProductController::class);
edit and create do not use the API so they are not in the list.

Can use: php artisan make:controller CarController --api
Will create a controller with only the 5 methods that use the API. 


Can bulk list Routes with apiResources instead of ApiResource or resource.
//Route::apiResources([
  'cars' => CarController::class,
  'products' => ProductController::class,
]);
